# NestJS Apps

## Introduction

Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.
It supports TypeScript (yet still enables pure JS) and combines elements of OOP, FP and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Nest by default uses Express (HTTP Server framework), but also can use Fastify.

Nest provides an abstraction above these NodeJS frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer.

## Philosophy

While plenty of libraries exist for Node, none of them effectively solve the main problem - Architecture.

Nest provides an OOTB application architecture which allows to create scalable and easily maintainable applications.
