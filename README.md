# NestJS Apps

## Introduction
Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables pure JS) and combines elements of OOP, FP and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Nest uses HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common NodeJS frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This allows developers the freedom to use third-party modules.

## Philosophy
While plenty of superb libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of - Architecture.

Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications.

## Installation
Use the Nest CLI, or clone a starter project (both will produce the same outcome).
